#### Install Toolchain
The toolchain is a set of tools that are used together to build nRF Connect SDK applications. It includes the assembler, compiler, linker, and CMake, among other tools.

The first time you open nRF Connect for VS Code, it will prompt you to install a toolchain. This usually happens when the extension does not find any installed toolchain on your machine.

Click on Install Toolchain. It will list the available versions of toolchains that can be downloaded and installed on your machine. Select the toolchain version that matches the nRF Connect SDK version you plan to use. We recommend using the latest released tag of nRF Connect SDK. Therefore, use the latest tagged version of the toolchain, as shown in the illustration video below.

Installing the Toolchain will take some time, depending on your development platform specifications and internet speed.
